            <h2>Frosted Flakes</h2>
            <img src= "https://images.kglobalservices.com/www.kelloggs.com/en_us/product/product_4508506/kicproductimage-121045_kicproductimage-121045.png">
            <p>Dry: Good crunch with a mild sweetness. A little too small and fragile for eating by the handful.
            <br<br>>With Oat Milk: Becomes mushy very quickly. Sugar is loss to the milk.</p>

            <h2>Honey Nut Cheerios</h2>
            <img src="https://www.cheerios.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/HNC_460x460.png">
            <p>Dry: A total banger; absolutely slaps; amazing; the treid and true; the true love of eating cereals dry. The King of Cereal.
            <br><br>With Milk: The milk leeches all the flavor from the cereal; the milk slowly becomes honey-flavored and the cereal soggy.</p>

            <h2>Honey-Comb</h2>
            <img src="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/50571109-e6d5-4ec9-bac7-abbf4de5622e_2.314d2ed92f4f5e48e2614da64bab736a.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF">
            <p>Dry: If Honey Nut Cheerios were unhealthy. You can tell this cereal was made with no health in mind from the crunch alone. While the crunch is the best
                 thing about it, they can go stale quite quickly and when they become stale, the beautiful and unhealthy crunch is lossed.
            <br><br>With Milk: I've never even tried it with milk :p</p>

            <h2>Lucky Charms</h2>
            <img src="https://www.pngkit.com/png/full/860-8608782_lucky-charms-cereal-png.png">
            <p>Dry: The grain part of the cereal is similar in sweetness to Honey Nut Cheerios, but the marshmallows are dusty and dehydratred. 
            <br><br>With Milk: Hydrates the marshmallows.</p>

            <h2>Cookie Crisp</h2>
            <img src="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/360598a2-e2b5-4ef2-8d85-36fe87723ca8_1.d18eee32b5baf54753940ed8a9cfa50a.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF">
            <p>Dry: Dry and unappetizing.
            <br><br>With Milk: Never had it that way, but presumably better than eating them dry.</p>
